          <span class='dropcap'>U</span>C Berkeley leads the country as one of the top universities empowering students to combat income inequality.
For students from lower-income backgrounds, higher education is a powerful gateway to climbing the income ladder.
When compared to liberal arts colleges such as Amherst or Ivies like Cornell, the UC system enrolls a
more diverse student body that cuts across all income brackets. </br></br>
For all its pitfalls in student diversity and support, Cal provides thousands of students each year
with a high-quality education who otherwise could not afford one.
Cal Bears return to their home communities with newfound knowledge about the world, determination to make an impact, and an expanded network. Some found their own businesses, others
move abroad. All of them bring the skills developed during their time at Berkeley. The Daily Californian investigated the rising financial pressures on Berkeley students, as well as
the paths recent alumni take after graduation. If you're curious about how many Bears go on to get an MD, or how much new grads make based on department, this article's for you.

      <h2 align='left'> Rising tuition, falling debt </h2>
      <article class="container">
        <p align='left'>
The cost of attending a four-year public university jumped 35% over the past decade, according to the College Board.
During the Great Recession, state funds allocated for public universities shrunk as tax revenue slowed and governments
scrambled to patch economic emergencies. Today's public universities are increasingly dependent on private donors for
assistance. UC Berkeley is no exception, as declining funding from the state of California and the rising cost of living
in the Bay Area strains both students and staff.</br></br>

Against this background of shrinking state budgets, student debt ballooned to $1.6 trillion in 2020. Student loans can burden households
decades beyond graduation and are a hot-button issue in the upcoming election. I graphed changes in the cost of attending UC Berkeley
using data from the US Department of Education's IPEDS database.</br></br>
Despite rising tuition, Berkeley is an exception to the rule. The average financial debt of each graduating class has remained steady or declined
since 2010 and actually dipped down to $14,629 in 2016. Though I can't definitively say why rising tuition has not
led in higher student debt, larger financial scholarships likely helped offset the increase.
The average financial aid package per student rose from $21,587 in the school year 2010-11 to $25,162 in 2015-16.

        In the face of rising debt and an uncertain economic future, students may feel pressure to choose majors that promise lucrative careers.
        The financial pressures of student loan debt endanger a core value of university education: the opportunity to explore passion over profession.
        Students we spoke to brought up familial pressures and personal guilt regarding their choice of major.
        One student mentioned that she entered college hoping to pursue a degree in classics, yet switched into computer science
        because she was concerned about her ability to pay off student loans after graduation. Other students are confident that their choice will pay off.</br></br>

        "I'm proud to remain in a major that I love. Personally, I can't imagine doing anything else,"
        said a graduating senior, who requested anonymity.</br></br>

        Every student has a unique economic situation, and choice of major
        is just one of many decisions that students must make about their financial future.
        Below, you can see the income distribution of new
        graduates from each college in Berkeley. Each boxplot represents the lower quartile,
        median, and upper quartile of a graduating class from the college.

      </p>

      <img src="images/box.png" alt="" width="1150" height="375"></br></br></br>

      <p align='left'>
      Interestingly, the upper quartile of the Letters and Sciences school jumped significantly over the past few years. This can largely be explained by a spike
      in the number of L&S Computer Science majors over the past few years. In 2015-16, Berkeley granted 422 Computer Science degrees. In 2018-19, the school granted
      706 Computer Science degrees, according to Cal Answers.
      Otherwise, the numbers remain fairly consistent -- small fluctuations can be explained by variation in response rates between colleges and over the years.

    <article class="container">
      <p align='left'>Next, we investigate the geographic distribution of the new graduating class.
        we broke the data down by college to visualize the differing paths of new grads based
        on their specialties. Depending on the types of careers students decide to pursue,
        they may end up in different places.

    <article class="container">
      <p align='left'>Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of new grads decide to stay in the Bay Area.
        As seen in the chart above, over half of graduates from all six schools stay in the Bay Area.
        Students in the College of Chemistry are the least likely to stay, while Environmental
        Design majors are most likely remain, with 78% planning to reside in the Bay immediately after graduation.
        With plentiful opportunities for technology, business, law, medicine, politics, and design, the Bay Area
        is a natural choice for new grads who have already spent four years growing accustomed to its charms.</br></br>

        Below, you can see a visualization of the places new Berkeley alumni live outside the Bay Area. In the diagram, you
        can follow a link from left to right to see the percentage of students from that college planning
        to live in the area on the right side. Thicker links denote more students moving to that area.

      Destinations outside the Bay Area are more varied across the colleges. Haas alums are most likely to end up in
      the Northeast, with 11% planning on living there. Los Angeles is another popular destination for Cal Bears: 12% of engineering
      majors and 12% of Environmental Design alums decide to live in LA.</br></br>

      The percentage of alums moving internationally is fairly constant across the college at around 5%.</p>

        Berkeley boasts a thriving startup landscape, with nearby funds like the House and accelerators such as Skydeck helping
        to support entrepreneurs who are either current students or alumni. The Bay Area Economic Council recently performed a study
        on entrepreneurship across the UC system, documenting all startups founded between 1968 and 2015 by alumni from UC schools.
        Below, you can see a visualization of the startups: the school where founders graduated from, the good or service provided,
        and whether they remain active today.

        Among UC universities, the data catalogs 260 startups founded by Berkeley alums, of which 99 remain active. This is likely only a
        fraction of the whole entrepreneurship ecosystem.</br></br>

        Berkeley specializes in software and electronic systems startups.
