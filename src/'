The cost of attending a four-year public university jumped 35% over the past decade, according to the College Board.
During the Great Recession, state funds allocated for public universities shrunk as tax revenue slowed and governments
scrambled to patch economic emergencies. Today's public universities are increasingly dependent on private donors for
assistance. </br></br>

Against this background of shrinking state budgets, student debt ballooned to $1.6 trillion in 2020, burdens households even
decades beyond graduation, and is a pressing political question in the 2020 presidential election. To examine the effects of
tuition and student debt in the context of Berkeley, I used data from the US Department of Education's IPEDS database.

Despite the rising tuition costs, the average financial debt of each graduating class has remained steady or declined
since 2010. Financial scholarships from the school have increased since 2010.

Recent literature analyzes trends toward declining resources for public universities,
changing administrative practices, and ballooning student debt to quantify the
autonomy of academic institutions to pursue basic research free from interference
(Aberbach and Christensen, 2018). In an era of declining state support for the
University of California schools, administrators are turning to budget-conscious
efforts to cut spending and raise money from donors. The Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities published a report in 2016 on the effect of rising tuition and
financial pressures on students’ freedom to pursue their own interests as the
expense of future earnings. we believe this is a major gap in
our understanding of Berkeley’s institutional history and how the student
experience has evolved in light of recent developments.</p>
